# Independent projects and Programs

This repository contains individual independent projects and programs successfully executed by me. All the programs in this repository are in C/C++. Each and every program is running to the best of my knowledge. A great deal of time and effort has been put in creating this repository. Almost all of the programs are compiled and tested in C++ shell and Online C++ compiler.

# Contents:
This repository contains problems on the following Data Structures and algorithms:
1. Array - ADT
2. Stack
3. Queue - Priority
4. Linked List - Singly, doubly, circular
5. Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
6. Matrix - sparse
7. Graphs
8. Searching Algorithms
9. sorting Algorithms
10. Hashing
11. Heaps - Max, min
12. Recursion and backtracking

# Instructions to execute the programs
Use any online C++ compiler to run these codes. You can also use any IDE's like Eclipse, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks to run these.

# Credits
